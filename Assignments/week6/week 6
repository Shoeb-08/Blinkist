1. For the ERD in Figure , you should indicate the applications of the entity type rule. For each entity type rule application, you should identify the table name, primary key, and other columns. You do not need to write CREATE TABLE statements.
A: 	Table:		Student
	PrimaryKey:	StdNo
	Attributes:	StdNo,StdName,StdAddress,StdCity,StdState,StdZip,StdEmail

	Table:		Institution
	PrimaryKey:	InstID
	Attributes:	InstID,InstName,InstMascot

	Table:		Loan
	PrimaryKey:	LoanNo
	Attributes:       LoanNo,ProcDate,DisbMethod,DisbBank,DateAuth,NoteValue,
			Subsidized,Rate

	Table:		Lender
	PrimaryKey:	LenderNo
	Attributes:	LenderNo,LendName

 	Table:		Institution
	PrimaryKey:	InstID
	Attributes:	InstID,InstName,InstMascot
	
	Table:		DisburseLine
	PrimaryKey:	Datasent
	Attributes:	Datasent,Amount,OrigFee,GuarFee

2. For the ERD in Figure , you should indicate applications of the 1-M relationship rule. For each 1-     M relationship rule application, you should indicate the changes to the tables you listed in problem 1 including foreign key columns and NOT NULL constraints for foreign keys if necessary.

A:
	1-M relationships present in given ERD are:
		Student-Loan
		Institution-Loan
		Lender-Loan
	Changed Tables:
		Table:		Loan
		PrimaryKey:	LoanNo
		ForeignKeys:	StdNo,InstID,LenderNo
		Attributes:  	LoanNo,StdNo,InstID,LenderNo,ProcDate,DisbMethod,
				DisbBank,DateAuth,NoteValue,Subsidized,Rate
		NOT NULL:	StdNo,InstID,LenderNo,LoanNo

3. For the ERD in Figure , you should indicate applications of the M-N relationship rule. For each M-N relationship rule application, you should list the table name, primary key, and other columns.
A:
	No M-N relationships in given figure

4.	For the ERD in Figure , you should indicate applications of the identifying relationship rule. For each identifying relationship rule application, you should indicate the changes to the tables you listed in problem 2.

A:
	Loan-DisburseLine  is the identifying relationship in given figure

	Changed Tables:
	Table:		DisburseLine
	PrimaryKey:	LoanNo,Datasent
	Attributes:	LoanNo,Datasent,Amount,OrigFee,GuarFee

5.   Convert the ERD shown in Figure 2 into tables.  List the conversion rules used and table design. For each table, you should list the primary key, foreign keys, other columns, and NOT NULL constraints for foreign keys if necessary. You do not need to write CREATE TABLE statements.
	
A:	Table:		Account
	PrimaryKey:	AcctId
	Attributes:	AcctId,AcctName,Balance

		
6. Convert the ERD shown in Figure into tables.  List the conversion rules used and table design. For each table, you should list the primary key, foreign keys, other columns, and NOT NULL constraints for foreign keys if necessary. You do not need to write CREATE TABLE statements.

A: 
	Table:		Owner
	PrimaryKey:	OwnId
	Attributes:  	OwnId,OwnName,OwnPhone

	Table:		Property
	PrimaryKey:	PropId
	Attributes:  	PropId,BldgName,UnitNo,Bdrms

	Table:		Shares
	PrimaryKey:	OwnId,PropId
	Attributes:  	OwnId,PropId,StartWeek,EndWeek
